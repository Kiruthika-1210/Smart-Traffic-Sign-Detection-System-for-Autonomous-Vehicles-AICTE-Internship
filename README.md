Smart-Traffic-Sign-Detection-System-for-Autonomous-Vehicles-AICTE-Internship
A deep learningâ€“based Traffic Sign Detection System built using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. This project enables real-time detection and classification of traffic signs to assist autonomous vehicles in understanding and responding to road conditions.
WEEK1
What This Project Intends to Do ?
-> Detect and classify multiple traffic signs from images or video streams.
-> Help autonomous vehicles interpret road conditions accurately.
-> Provide real-time feedback for safe navigation.
-> Demonstrate the application of AI in computer vision and intelligent transport systems.
